# Computational Modelling Social Systems
[Denis Helic](https://courses.isds.tugraz.at/dhelic/), 2023

Welcome to the online materials for Computational Modelling of Social Systems. 
In this course, you will learn how to formulate and analyze computational models of social systems, in particular to study social interaction and the behavior of large groups of people and whole societies. The course integrates contents about social dynamics and analytic tools to understand the complex behavior of social systems. After this course, you will acquire programming skills to implement, simulate, and visualize these models.

## Who am I?

I am the Professor of Data Science at the [Modul University Vienna](https://www.modul.ac.at/), where I am the Head of School of Applied Data Science. My background is Computer Science but in my research I collaborate also with psychologists, social scientists and physicists to learn new ways to understand user and human behavior. I got my PhD from Graz University in Technology in 2001 and a habilitation in 2007. To learn more about my research, check my [publications](https://scholar.google.at/citations?user=7tAilWQAAAAJ&hl=de). I teach this course in collaboration with a postdoctoral researcher from Graz University of Technology [Dr. Petar Jerčić](https://petarjercic.com/).

## Course Contents
The course is organized in 11 lectures grouped together in 4 blocks, plus two sessions for the project discusssion and two session for the final project presentations. The course contains lectures and exercises in python to apply what you learned in the lecture. The online materials do not contain the solutions to the exercises, but if you are stuck or want to start from an easier point, in the github folder of the exercise you can find a version of the exercise with hints. We will add links to materials and readings a few days before each session.

### Block 1: Fundamentals of agent-based modelling

*(Please install Jupyter Notebook before the tutorial sessions takes place, where we can provide help with the installation if something goes wrong.)* The easiest way is using the [Anaconda](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) distribution, since it is well supported and maintained.

## Where to access materials

- Reading lists, codes, and data can be found on the [Github repository of the course](https://github.com/pjercic/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems2023).
- Students at TU Graz can access the [course at Teach Center](https://tc.tugraz.at/main/enrol/index.php?id=4384) to get additional information, watch videos, and to participate in the forums.

## Place and time

The course takes place on Wednesdays at 15:15 (sharp), with a **lecture followed by an exercise session**. The sessions of the course will take place in room [HS A, Kopernikusgasse 24, 1st floor](https://online.tugraz.at/tug_online/ris.ris?pOrgNr=37&pQuellGeogrBTypNr=5&pZielGeogrBTypNr=5&pZielGeogrBerNr=350001&pRaumNr=4010&pActionFlag=A&pShowEinzelraum=J).

There is an extra online exercise support group on Tuesday at 11:00 (sharp). Check TeachCenter for the webex link.

## Course grading

The assessment for the course is based on four components:

TODO (dates):- Exercises done in groups of **one or two students**
  - Exercise 1: ungraded
  - Exercise 2: **25% of final grade**. Deadline: 18.04.2022
  - Exercise 3: **25% of final grade**. Deadline: 23.05.2022
  - Exercise 4: ungraded
  
- Final group project in groups of **up to four students**. Projects are linked to two evaluations:
  - Participation in group presentation sessions (both as presenter and discussant): **25% of final grade**
  - Project report and codes: **25% of final grade**

You can find more information about the project presentations and reports, including deadlines, in the [projects guide.](https://pjercic.github.io/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems2023/ProjectsGuide.html) You can also find some guidance and recommendations in the [slides of the project support session.]()

Graded exercises need to be submitted on teach center by the deadline (end of day in Graz time). We will provide solution files for ungraded exercises for you to check your progress. Nevertheless, we expect to see in your projects the techniques covered in the exercises, both graded and ungraded.
